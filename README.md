# HyperExecute Pytest Appium ![pw](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-FFD43B?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=blue)


HyperExecute is a smart test orchestration platform to run end-to-end Selenium tests at the fastest speed possible. HyperExecute lets you achieve an accelerated time to market by providing a test infrastructure that offers optimal speed, test orchestration, and detailed execution logs.

The overall experience helps teams test code and fix issues at a much faster pace. HyperExecute is configured using a YAML file. Instead of moving the Hub close to you, HyperExecute brings the test scripts close to the Hub!

# Pre-requisites

Before using HyperExecute, you have to download HyperExecute CLI corresponding to the host OS. Along with it, you also need to export the environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

## Download HyperExecute CLI

HyperExecute CLI is the CLI for interacting and running the tests on the HyperExecute Grid. The CLI provides a host of other useful features that accelerate test execution. In order to trigger tests using the CLI, you need to download the HyperExecute CLI binary corresponding to the platform (or OS) from where the tests are triggered:

Also, it is recommended to download the binary in the project's parent directory. Shown below is the location from where you can download the HyperExecute CLI binary:

* Mac: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
* Linux: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute
* Windows: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe

## Configure Environment Variables

Before the tests are run, please set the environment variables LT_USERNAME & LT_ACCESS_KEY from the terminal. The account details are available on your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

For macOS:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Linux:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Windows:

```bash
set LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

## Auto-Split Execution with Cucumber

Auto-split execution mechanism lets you run tests at predefined concurrency and distribute the tests over the available infrastructure. Concurrency can be achieved at different levels - file, module, test suite, test, scenario, etc.

For more information about auto-split execution, check out the [Auto-Split Getting Started Guide](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-hyperexecute/#smart-auto-test-splitting)

### Core

Auto-split YAML file (*yaml/win/cucumber_hyperexecute_autosplit_sample.yaml*) in the repo contains the following configuration:

```yaml
globalTimeout: 150
testSuiteTimeout: 150
testSuiteStep: 150
```

Global timeout, testSuite timeout, and testSuite timeout are set to 150 minutes.
¬†
The *runson* key determines the platform (or operating system) on which the tests are executed. Here we have set the target OS as Windows.

```yaml
runson: linux
```

Auto-split is set to true in the YAML file.

```yaml
¬†autosplit: true
```

*retryOnFailure* is set to true, instructing HyperExecute to retry failed command(s). The retry operation is carried out till the number of retries mentioned in *maxRetries* are exhausted or the command execution results in a *Pass*. In addition, the concurrency (i.e. number of parallel sessions) is set to 4.

```yaml
retryOnFailure: true
maxRetries: 2
concurrency: 2
```

Steps (or commands) that must run before the test execution are listed in the *pre* run step.

```yaml
pre:
  - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The *testDiscovery* directive contains the command that gives details of the mode of execution, along with detailing the command that is used for test execution. Here, we are fetching the list of class names that would be further passed in the *testRunnerCommand*

```yaml
testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: static
  command: grep -nri 'class' tests -ir --include=\*.py | sed 's/:.*//'
```

The *testRunnerCommand* contains the command that is used for triggering the test. The output fetched from the *testDiscoverer* command acts as an input to the *testRunner* command.

```yaml
testRunnerCommand: python3 -m pytest
```


### Test Execution

The CLI option *--config* is used for providing the custom HyperExecute YAML file (i.e. *--config hyperExecute_autosplit.yaml* 

#### Execute tests using Autosplit mechanism.

Run the following command on the terminal to trigger Cucumber tests on the Windows platform. 

```bash
./hyperexecute --config hyperExecute_autosplit.yaml

```
